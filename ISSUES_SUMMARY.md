# Issues Encountered & Solutions - Summary for PR/Issues

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all issues encountered during the development of the Confidential Perpetual DEX project, suitable for creating GitHub issues or pull requests.

## 📋 Executive Summary

During development, we encountered **12 major issues** across compilation, deployment, and development server setup. All issues have been resolved or documented with workarounds. This document serves as a reference for:

- Creating GitHub issues for upstream libraries (fhevm)
- Documenting breaking changes from library updates
- Helping future developers avoid the same pitfalls
- Providing comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## 🔴 Critical Issues (Breaking Changes)

### 1. fhEVM API Breaking Changes

**Severity:** Critical
**Component:** Smart Contract Compilation
**Affects:** All contract functionality

**Issues Identified:**
- `GatewayCaller.sol` import path doesn't exist
- `einput` type not available
- `TFHE.allow()` / `TFHE.allowThis()` functions missing
- `TFHE.req()` function missing
- Encrypted division not supported

**Root Cause:**
Major API changes between fhevm versions without clear migration guide.

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Upstream (fhevm library):**
   - Provide migration guide for API changes
   - Add deprecation warnings before removing features
   - Maintain API stability or semantic versioning
   - Document which features are available in each version

2. **Documentation Needed:**
   - Clear changelog with breaking changes
   - Examples for each API version
   - Migration path documentation

3. **This Project:**
   - Updated all contract code to use current API
   - Documented limitations clearly
   - Provided workarounds where possible

**Files Affected:**
- `contracts/ConfidentialPerpDEX.sol` (entire file)

**GitHub Issue Template:**
```markdown
Title: [BREAKING] API incompatibility between fhevm versions

**Environment:**
- fhevm version: 0.4.0
- Solidity version: 0.8.24

**Issue:**
Multiple API changes without migration documentation:
1. GatewayCaller import doesn't exist
2. einput type removed
3. ACL functions (allow/allowThis) missing
4. TFHE.req() function removed
5. Encrypted division not supported

**Expected:**
- Migration guide for version upgrades
- Deprecation warnings before removal
- Backward compatibility or clear versioning

**Actual:**
- Compilation errors with no clear resolution path
- No documentation on API changes
- Breaking changes without warning

**Impact:**
Projects cannot compile without significant rewrites.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Add MIGRATION.md to fhevm repository
- Document available functions per version
- Provide migration scripts or clear guides
```

## 🟡 Configuration Issues

### 2. Module Type Conflicts (ES Modules vs CommonJS)

**Severity:** High
**Component:** Build Configuration
**Affects:** All build scripts

**Issue:**
Package.json specifies `"type": "module"` but Hardhat requires CommonJS.

**Error:**
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Renamed config files to `.cjs` extension
- Updated package.json script references

**Prevention:**
Either:
- Use `"type": "commonjs"` in package.json (recommended for Hardhat projects)
- Or use `.cjs` extension for all Hardhat files (current approach)

**Files Changed:**
- `hardhat.config.js` → `hardhat.config.cjs`
- `scripts/deploy.js` → `scripts/deploy.cjs`
- `package.json` (script references)

**For Hardhat Team:**
This is a common pain point. Consider:
- Supporting ES modules natively
- Better error messages explaining the solution
- Documentation section on ES module projects

---

### 3. Network Configuration Issues

**Severity:** Medium
**Component:** Deployment
**Affects:** Initial deployment

**Issues:**
1. Zama devnet URL not reachable
2. No alternative networks configured
3. No local network option

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Added Sepolia testnet configuration
- Added localhost network configuration
- Created multiple deployment scripts
- Documented network alternatives

**Files Changed:**
- `hardhat.config.cjs` - Added networks
- `.env` - Added SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
- `package.json` - Added deploy:sepolia, deploy:local scripts

**Best Practice:**
Always provide multiple network options:
- Public testnet (Sepolia)
- Local development (Hardhat node)
- Production network

---

## 🟢 Development Environment Issues

### 4. Port Already in Use

**Severity:** Low
**Component:** Development Server
**Affects:** Frontend development

**Issue:**
Port 3000 occupied by another process (Next.js server).

**Error:**
```
OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use
```

**Solutions Provided:**
1. Changed default port to 8080
2. Added script to use port 3000 if available
3. Documented how to kill existing processes

**Files Changed:**
- `package.json` - Updated dev script to port 8080

**Commands:**
```bash
# Find and kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
# or
netstat -tlnp | grep :3000  # Find PID, then kill
```

---

### 5. Python Command Not Found

**Severity:** Low
**Component:** Development Server
**Affects:** Some Linux distributions

**Issue:**
System has `python3` but not `python` symlink.

**Solution:**
Script already includes fallback (`python3 || python`), but documented alternatives.

**Status:** Already handled in package.json

## 📊 FHE Limitations (Not Bugs, But Important)

### 6-11. FHE Library Functional Limitations

These are not bugs but inherent limitations of the current FHE implementation:

**6. No Conditional Execution on Encrypted Booleans**
- Cannot use `ebool` in `if` statements
- Cannot use `TFHE.req()` for encrypted requirements
- **Impact:** Order matching, liquidation checks can't be enforced

**7. No Access Control Lists (ACL)**
- `TFHE.allow()` functions don't exist
- **Impact:** Cannot restrict decryption access

**8. Division Requires Plaintext Divisor**
- Cannot divide encrypted by encrypted
- **Impact:** Leverage must be public

**9. No Input Proof Separation**
- `einput` type removed
- Now uses `bytes memory` directly
- **Impact:** API change requiring code updates

**Status:** All documented in README.md with detailed explanations

---

## 📝 Proposed GitHub Issues

### For fhevm Repository

**Issue 1: API Migration Guide Needed**
```markdown
Title: Provide migration guide for API changes between versions

We encountered multiple breaking changes when upgrading fhevm:
- GatewayCaller removed
- einput type removed
- ACL functions removed
- TFHE.req() removed

Request:
- Add MIGRATION.md documenting changes between versions
- Provide code examples for migration
- Add deprecation warnings before removing features

This would save developers hours of trial-and-error.
```

**Issue 2: Document Available FHE Operations**
```markdown
Title: Comprehensive documentation of supported operations

Current documentation doesn't clearly state which operations are supported:
- ✅ Addition, subtraction, multiplication
- ✅ Comparisons (ge, le, lt, etc.)
- ❌ Division by encrypted values
- ❌ Conditional execution on encrypted booleans
- ❌ Access control lists

Request:
- Matrix of supported operations
- Explanation of limitations
- Workarounds for common patterns
```

**Issue 3: Improve Error Messages**
```markdown
Title: Better error messages for unsupported operations

When using unsupported FHE operations, errors are cryptic:
"Member 'div' not found" - doesn't explain division limitations
"Member 'req' not found" - doesn't explain conditional limitations

Suggest:
Custom error messages explaining FHE constraints and workarounds
```

describe("Encrypted Operations", () => {
  it("should handle encrypted addition", async () => {
    // Test TFHE.add()
  });

  it("should fail gracefully on insufficient balance", async () => {
    // Test subtraction failure
  });

  it("should calculate PnL correctly", async () => {
    // Test encrypted arithmetic
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests:**
```javascript
// Test full trading workflow
describe("Trading Workflow", () => {
  it("should deposit, trade, and withdraw", async () => {
    // Complete workflow test
  });
});
```

**Frontend Tests:**
```javascript
// Test UI encryption
describe("Encryption UI", () => {
  it("should encrypt values before sending", async () => {
    // Test encryption flow
  });
});
```
