# Stop Loss & Take Profit Feature

**Date Added:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

Added comprehensive **Stop Loss** and **Take Profit** risk management functionality to the Confidential Perpetual DEX. Users can now set encrypted stop loss and take profit levels when opening positions, enabling automatic position closure at predetermined price levels.

---

## Features

### Smart Contract Features

#### 1. **Encrypted Stop Loss & Take Profit Storage**
```solidity
struct EncryptedPosition {
    euint64 size;
    euint64 entryPrice;
    euint64 collateral;
    uint8 leverage;
    bool isLong;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool isOpen;
    euint64 stopLoss;      // NEW: Encrypted stop loss price
    euint64 takeProfit;    // NEW: Encrypted take profit price
}
```

#### 2. **Open Position with Risk Management**
```solidity
function openPosition(
    bytes memory encSize,
    uint8 leverage,
    bool isLong,
    bytes memory encStopLoss,      // NEW
    bytes memory encTakeProfit     // NEW
) external returns (bytes32 positionId)
```

**Features:**
- Fully encrypted stop loss and take profit prices
- Optional parameters (can set to 0 to disable)
- Validates position parameters
- Emits `PositionOpened` event

#### 3. **Update Stop Loss & Take Profit**
```solidity
function updateStopLossTakeProfit(
    bytes32 positionId,
    bytes memory encStopLoss,
    bytes memory encTakeProfit
) external
```

**Features:**
- Update SL/TP for existing positions
- Only position owner can update
- Emits `StopLossTakeProfitUpdated` event
- Can disable by setting to 0

#### 4. **Check Trigger Conditions**
```solidity
function checkStopLossTakeProfit(
    address trader,
    bytes32 positionId
) public view returns (
    ebool slTriggered,
    ebool tpTriggered
)
```

**Logic:**

**For LONG positions:**
- Stop Loss triggers when: `current_price < stop_loss_price`
- Take Profit triggers when: `current_price > take_profit_price`

**For SHORT positions:**
- Stop Loss triggers when: `current_price > stop_loss_price`
- Take Profit triggers when: `current_price < take_profit_price`

#### 5. **Execute Stop Loss/Take Profit**
```solidity
function executeStopLossTakeProfit(
    address trader,
    bytes32 positionId
) external
```

**Features:**
- Can be called by anyone (permissionless keeper network)
- Checks trigger conditions
- Closes position and returns collateral + PnL
- Emits appropriate event

**Note:** Due to FHE limitations, actual conditional execution requires an oracle or keeper network with FHE verification.

## FHE Considerations & Limitations

### Privacy Benefits

✅ **Fully Encrypted:**
- Stop loss prices are encrypted on-chain
- Take profit prices are encrypted on-chain
- Traders' risk management strategies remain private
- No one can see your stop loss levels

### Technical Limitations

⚠️ **FHE Conditional Execution:**

The main limitation is that we **cannot conditionally execute** based on encrypted boolean values in FHE.

**What this means:**
```solidity
// This CANNOT work in FHE:
if (slTriggered) {
    closePosition();
}

// Because slTriggered is encrypted (ebool)
// and Solidity can't branch on encrypted values
```

**Production Solutions:**

1. **Decryption Oracle:**
   - Keeper network requests decryption of trigger condition
   - Oracle verifies with zero-knowledge proof
   - Keeper executes closure if triggered

2. **Threshold Decryption:**
   - Multiple keepers hold decryption key shares
   - Threshold number must agree to decrypt
   - Decentralized execution network

3. **FHE Circuits:**
   - Future FHE improvements may support conditional execution
   - Would enable fully trustless automated closure
   - Currently in research phase

**Current Implementation:**
- `checkStopLossTakeProfit()` returns encrypted booleans
- `executeStopLossTakeProfit()` can be called permissionlessly
- Requires external verification (oracle/keeper)
- Documented limitation in code comments

## Events

### New Events Added

```solidity
event StopLossTriggered(
    address indexed trader,
    bytes32 indexed positionId
);

event TakeProfitTriggered(
    address indexed trader,
    bytes32 indexed positionId
);

event StopLossTakeProfitUpdated(
    address indexed trader,
    bytes32 indexed positionId
);
```

### Usage

**Listen for SL/TP updates:**
```javascript
contract.on('StopLossTakeProfitUpdated', (trader, positionId) => {
    console.log(`Updated SL/TP for position ${positionId}`);
    refreshPositions();
});
```

**Listen for triggered stops:**
```javascript
contract.on('StopLossTriggered', (trader, positionId) => {
    console.log(`Stop loss triggered for ${positionId}`);
    showNotification('Stop loss executed!');
});
```

## Risk/Reward Ratio Guide

### Understanding Risk/Reward

**Formula:**
```
Risk = |Entry Price - Stop Loss|
Reward = |Entry Price - Take Profit|
Ratio = Reward / Risk
```

**Example:**
- Entry: $50,000
- Stop Loss: $48,000
- Take Profit: $54,000
- Risk = $2,000
- Reward = $4,000
- **Ratio = 1:2.0**

### Quality Guidelines

| Ratio | Quality | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| < 1:1 | ❌ Poor | Avoid - Risk > Reward |
| 1:1 - 1:2 | ⚠️ Fair | Acceptable for experienced traders |
| 1:2 - 1:3 | ✅ Good | Recommended for most trades |
| > 1:3 | 🌟 Excellent | High-quality setup |

### Professional Trading Standards

**Minimum Recommended:** 1:2 ratio
- For every $1 at risk, target $2 in profit
- Allows for 33% win rate and still be profitable
- Industry standard for risk management

**Conservative Approach:** 1:3 ratio
- Higher quality setups
- Better risk-adjusted returns
- Suitable for lower win rates

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Stop Loss

**Why:**
- Limits maximum loss per trade
- Protects against flash crashes
- Prevents emotional decision-making
- Essential for risk management

**Recommendation:** Never trade without a stop loss unless you're an expert.

### 2. Maintain Good Risk/Reward Ratios

**Target:** Minimum 1:2 ratio

**Benefits:**
- Profitable even with 40% win rate
- Better long-term performance
- Reduced emotional stress
- Professional trading approach

### 3. Position Sizing

**Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account Risk) / (Stop Loss Distance)
```

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 2% ($200)
- Entry: $50,000
- Stop Loss: $48,000
- Distance: $2,000
- **Position Size: 0.1 BTC**

### 4. Adjust for Leverage

**Higher leverage = tighter stops:**
- 5x leverage: 2-3% stop loss
- 10x leverage: 1-2% stop loss
- 20x leverage: 0.5-1% stop loss

**Lower leverage = wider stops:**
- 2x leverage: 5-10% stop loss
- 1x leverage: 10-20% stop loss

## FAQ

**Q: Can I change my stop loss after opening a position?**
A: Yes! Use the `updateStopLossTakeProfit()` function to modify SL/TP at any time.

**Q: What happens if I don't set a stop loss?**
A: Position will only close via manual closure or liquidation. Not recommended.

**Q: Are my stop loss levels visible to others?**
A: No, they are fully encrypted on-chain. Only you know your exact levels.

**Q: Can someone see my risk/reward ratio?**
A: No, it's calculated client-side and never sent on-chain.

**Q: What if the price gaps through my stop loss?**
A: You may experience slippage. The position closes at the next available price.

**Q: Who executes my stop loss?**
A: A permissionless keeper network can execute it when triggered.

**Q: Do I pay gas for stop loss execution?**
A: The keeper pays gas and may receive a small fee from your collateral.

**Q: Can I have a guaranteed stop loss?**
A: No, blockchain-based systems cannot guarantee execution, only best-effort.

**Q: What's the minimum stop loss distance?**
A: No minimum, but too tight stops may get triggered by normal volatility.
