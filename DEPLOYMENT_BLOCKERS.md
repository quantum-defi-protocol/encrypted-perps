# Deployment Blockers - Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Blocked - Zama Devnet Unreachable

---

## Executive Summary

The Confidential Perpetual DEX contract is ready for deployment, but we are currently **blocked** from deploying to any network due to FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) compatibility requirements.

**Key Issue:** The contract requires FHE operations that are only available on Zama's devnet, but the devnet is currently unreachable.

---

## Deployment Attempts

### 1. Sepolia Testnet - FAILED ‚ùå

**Attempted:** 2025-10-21
**Network:** Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
**Chain ID:** 11155111
**RPC URL:** https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com

**Error:**
```
ProviderError: execution reverted
    at HttpProvider.request
    at HardhatEthersProvider.estimateGas
    at ContractFactory.deploy
```

**Root Cause:**
The contract uses FHE-specific operations from the `fhevm` library that are not supported on standard Ethereum networks:
- `TFHE.asEuint64()` - Convert to encrypted uint64
- `euint64` types - Encrypted integers
- `TFHE.add()`, `TFHE.sub()`, `TFHE.mul()` - Encrypted arithmetic
- FHE precompiles and operations

**Why it Failed:**
Sepolia (and all standard Ethereum networks) do not have:
- FHE precompiled contracts
- Support for encrypted types
- TFHE library functionality

**Verdict:** Cannot deploy to Sepolia without completely rewriting the contract to remove all FHE functionality.

### 2. Zama Devnet - BLOCKED üö´

**Attempted:** 2025-10-21
**Network:** Zama FHE Devnet
**Chain ID:** 9000 (updated from 8009)
**RPC URL:** https://devnet.zama.ai

**Error:**
```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND devnet.zama.ai
    errno: -3008,
    code: 'ENOTFOUND',
    syscall: 'getaddrinfo',
    hostname: 'devnet.zama.ai'
```

**Investigation Results:**

1. **DNS Resolution Failed:**
   ```bash
   ping devnet.zama.ai
   # Result: Name or service not known
   ```

2. **HTTP Connection Failed:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://devnet.zama.ai
   # Result: Could not resolve host
   ```

3. **Network Not Reachable:**
   The domain `devnet.zama.ai` does not resolve to any IP address.

**Configuration Updates Made:**
- Updated Chain ID from 8009 ‚Üí 9000 (per latest docs)
- Verified RPC URL matches documentation
- Confirmed private key is configured

**Current Status:**
The Zama devnet infrastructure is either:
- Not yet publicly accessible
- Temporarily down
- Requires special access/registration
- Using a different domain/URL

**Documentation Reference:**
- Zama docs specify: `https://devnet.zama.ai`
- Chain ID: 9000
- Gateway: `https://gateway.devnet.zama.ai`
- Faucet: `https://faucet.zama.ai`

**Verdict:** Cannot proceed until Zama devnet becomes accessible.

---

### 3. Local Hardhat Network - NOT VIABLE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Network:** Hardhat Local (localhost)
**Chain ID:** 31337
**RPC URL:** http://127.0.0.1:8545

**Why it Won't Work:**
Local Hardhat network does not include:
- FHE precompiled contracts
- TFHE library support
- Encrypted type handling
- FHE coprocessor infrastructure

**Verdict:** Cannot test FHE functionality locally without Zama's FHE infrastructure.

---

## Technical Analysis

### Contract FHE Dependencies

The contract relies heavily on FHE operations from `fhevm/lib/TFHE.sol`:

**File:** `contracts/ConfidentialPerpDEX.sol`

**FHE Operations Used:**
1. **Type Conversions:**
   ```solidity
   TFHE.asEuint64(500)           // Convert to encrypted uint64
   ```

2. **Encrypted Arithmetic:**
   ```solidity
   TFHE.add(a, b)                // Encrypted addition
   TFHE.sub(a, b)                // Encrypted subtraction
   TFHE.mul(a, b)                // Encrypted multiplication
   ```

3. **Encrypted Comparisons:**
   ```solidity
   TFHE.lt(a, b)                 // Less than
   TFHE.le(a, b)                 // Less than or equal
   TFHE.gt(a, b)                 // Greater than
   ```

4. **Encrypted Data Types:**
   ```solidity
   euint64 size;                 // Encrypted uint64
   euint64 entryPrice;
   euint64 collateral;
   ```

5. **Conditional Selection:**
   ```solidity
   TFHE.select(condition, ifTrue, ifFalse)  // Encrypted ternary
   ```

**Total FHE Operations:** Used in >20 functions across the contract.

**Impact:** The contract is fundamentally built on FHE and cannot function without it.

## Paths Forward

### Option 1: Wait for Zama Devnet (RECOMMENDED)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Monitor Zama devnet status
- [ ] Check Zama Discord/GitHub for updates
- [ ] Test devnet accessibility daily
- [ ] Get test ZAMA tokens from faucet when available
- [ ] Deploy immediately when network is accessible

**Resources:**
- Zama Discord: [Check for community announcements]
- Zama GitHub: https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm
- Zama Docs: https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm
- Faucet: https://faucet.zama.ai (when available)

**Command to Deploy (when ready):**
```bash
npm run deploy
```

---

### Option 2: Contact Zama Team

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Join Zama Discord server
- [ ] Ask about devnet accessibility
- [ ] Request devnet status/timeline
- [ ] Check if registration is required
- [ ] Ask for alternative RPC endpoints

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Is devnet.zama.ai publicly accessible?
2. Is there an alternative RPC URL?
3. Do we need to register/whitelist our address?
4. What is the current devnet status?
5. Are there any known accessibility issues?

---

### Option 3: Create Non-FHE Test Version

**Pros:**
- Can test deployment flow
- Can test contract structure
- Can verify gas costs
- Can test on Sepolia immediately

**Cons:**
- Defeats the purpose of the project
- Removes all privacy features
- Significant code changes required
- Would need to maintain two versions
- Not suitable for production

**Effort Required:** 4-6 hours to create parallel non-FHE version

**Recommended:** Only if Zama devnet remains unavailable for extended period (>1 week).

---

### Option 4: Continue Frontend Development

**Action Items:**
- [x] Frontend is already functional
- [ ] Add mock contract interactions
- [ ] Implement UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Create demo with mocked data
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts for when devnet is ready

**Benefits:**
- Productive use of time
- Frontend ready when contract deploys
- Can create demo video with mocked interactions
- Improves user experience

## Configuration Status

### Current Configuration (Updated)

**File:** `hardhat.config.cjs`
```javascript
zama: {
  url: "https://devnet.zama.ai",
  chainId: 9000,  // ‚úÖ Updated from 8009
  accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
}
```

**File:** `.env`
```bash
RPC_URL=https://devnet.zama.ai
CHAIN_ID=9000  # ‚úÖ Updated from 8009
PRIVATE_KEY=0xff3985ec4f2bbee115277ff8d2ba58f58ce92459a6c3ba888a12f2dc3c19b326
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Still empty - awaiting deployment
```

**Status:** Configuration is correct per latest Zama documentation.

## Network Status Checks

### How to Check Devnet Status

**1. DNS Check:**
```bash
ping devnet.zama.ai
```
Expected when working: Should resolve to an IP address

**2. HTTP Check:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://devnet.zama.ai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}'
```
Expected when working: Should return `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x2328"}`
(0x2328 = 9000 in hex)

**3. Deployment Check:**
```bash
npm run deploy
```
Expected when working: Should deploy contract and return address

### Automated Status Check Script

Create `scripts/check-devnet.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üîç Checking Zama Devnet Status..."

# DNS check
if ping -c 1 devnet.zama.ai &> /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ DNS resolves"
else
    echo "‚ùå DNS does not resolve"
    exit 1
fi

# RPC check
response=$(curl -s -X POST https://devnet.zama.ai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}')

if echo "$response" | grep -q "0x2328"; then
    echo "‚úÖ RPC is responding (Chain ID: 9000)"
    echo "üöÄ Devnet is ready for deployment!"
else
    echo "‚ùå RPC not responding correctly"
    echo "Response: $response"
fi
```

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/check-devnet.sh
./scripts/check-devnet.sh
```
